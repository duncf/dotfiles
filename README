This repo contains a bunch of files that I like to keep with me on every box I
work on. There's no a lot in here right now, but I expect this to grow over
time.

Some of the files might be useful to other people.

I didn't write everything in here. Some of it is adapted or even copied from
other sources. I have tried to attribute sources wherever possible. Please let
me know if I missed something.

Enjoy.
